### 9) Can you tell us about a time you worked in a team to solve a problem?


 There was a time when our team was working on a project to develop an app that could help farmers identify plant diseases by analysing images of their crops. Everything was going well until we encountered a problem where the images were taking too long to load in the app. Despite our efforts to optimize the code for better performance, we didn't see any improvement. After some research, we discovered that the delay was caused by the application programming interface (API) calls needed to fetch the images. We realized that a more efficient approach would be to upload the images directly from the farmer's mobile devices to Amazon Web Service's S3 bucket service.
 Once we identified this solution, we worked together to implement the necessary changes in our app. We divided the tasks among team members based on our individual strengths and skills. Some focused on updating the app's interface to support image uploading, while others worked on integrating the S3 bucket service into our app. This experience taught us the importance of teamwork and creative problem-solving to overcome challenges.
